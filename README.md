### Abstract
These data contain the median age of residential structures in the City of St. Louis by census tract. These data are derived from the 2016 5-year American Community Survey estimates. These data can be previewed interactively using the [`.geoJSON` file in this repository](https://github.com/slu-openGIS/STL_HOUSING_MedianAge/blob/master/geoJSON/STL_HOUSING_MedianAge.geoJSON).

### Use with R
The [`gateway` package](https://github.com/slu-openGIS/gateway) can be used to download and import these data as a simple feature object:

```r
jeffCity <- gateway::gw_get_repo("STL_HOUSING_MedianAge")
```
